# React/Redux Personal Project

This project uses 

React.js
Redux
React-Redux
React-Router
Thunk
Axios

The project accesses the xkcd API:

https://xkcd.com/json.html

This API is from xkcd.com, a site whose main attractions are the comics. 

There is an entry page to the site, which is pretty simple and just takes clicking the 'enter' button to enter the site. 

Once inside, the main page displays the most recent commic from xkcd.com. There are two other views, accessible by buttons at the top or top left of the page, depending on screen size. One is 'random' which displays a random comic and has a 'new' button which pulls a new random comic in place of the current one. Each comic displayed on the main view and random view have buttons on above and below, labeled 'add to favorites' which will store the comic info in state and when the third view 'favorites' is accessed, all comics added to favorites are displayed. The favorites function will only allow an individual comic to be added once. 

That's it, enjoy!
